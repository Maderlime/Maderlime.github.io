								          		</br>
								              In the first part, given an interface QueueADT, I implemented it by using a
								          </br>circular array and use it to solve a real life problem.
								          </br> In the second part, given an abstract class Account,
								          </br>I created a checking and savings accounts and used
								          </br>them to simulate a bank with a variety of intricacies.
								                </br>

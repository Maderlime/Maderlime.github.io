By the end of my time in the program, I would like to have completed many projects I can be proud of, and learned concepts that I will remember.</p>

Eventually, I would like to pursue a career in the music business, but hopefully in an area where the skills I have learned and have yet to learn here will be of use. The use of technology in modern-day commercial music is great, and knowledge of programming will help greatly.
